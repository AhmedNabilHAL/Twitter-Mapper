# The Twitter Mapper

The Twitter Mapper is a graphical Java application that allows the user to specify keywords of interest, and monitors tweets from a service that samples Twitter in real time.<br>

This is the completed final project for UBCx SoftConst2x: Object Oriented Design

### Description:
when we run the application, a UI will appear with a map and a search box
on the left hand side. <br><br>

We can add new search queries by typing words into the box and pressing Enter.<br><br>
As soon as we add a new query, markers will start appearing on the map.
These markers represent tweets containing the queried word
from different locations around the globe.
If we hover over a specific marker, we will be able to see a preview of the tweet as well as the user's profile picture.
